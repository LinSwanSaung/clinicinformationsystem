      Write in a warm, supportive tone like you're talking to a friend or family member. Use simple everyday language, not medical jargon. Think of it as explaining things to someone you care about over a cup of tea. üçµ

      Cover these points (use emojis to make it friendly and scannable):
      
      ## üí™ What You Can Do
      Give 3-5 practical, easy-to-follow tips for managing this condition. Start with the simplest things they can do today.
      
      ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Watch Out For
      List 3-5 warning signs or things to avoid. Be honest but not scary - frame it as "your body might be telling you something."
      
      ## üö® When to Call Your Doctor
      Explain specific symptoms that mean "don't wait, get help now." Make it clear and urgent but not panic-inducing.
      
      ## üåü Living Well With This
      Share 2-3 lifestyle changes that can make a real difference. Focus on what they CAN do, not just what they can't.
      
      ## üí° One More Thing
      Add a brief, encouraging note - maybe a "did you know?" fact or a reassuring message.
      
      Use short paragraphs, bullet points where helpful, and a conversational tone. Include relevant emojis to break up the text and make it feel less clinical.
      
      End with: *Remember, this is general guidance to help you understand your condition better. Always follow your doctor's specific advice for your situation - they know you best! üíô*`;

      üò¥ **Sleeping Better** - Actual tips that work, not just "go to bed earlier"
      ü©∫ **Staying Healthy** - Smart preventive care that's not overwhelming
      
      Write like you're texting a friend - short sentences, upbeat tone, maybe throw in an emoji or two. Focus on small wins and realistic changes, not perfection.
      
      Give 5-6 tips total, mixing from different areas. End each tip with a quick "why it matters" or a fun fact to keep it interesting.
      
      Format as a friendly numbered list with emojis. Make it feel like "you got this!" not "you should do this." ‚ú®`;
