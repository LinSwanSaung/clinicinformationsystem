**Date**: October 31, 2025

---

## ✅ CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. ✅ Fixed Doctor File Management Features
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/doctor/PatientMedicalRecordManagement.jsx`

- **View File**: Now opens documents in a new tab using `file_url`
- **Download File**: Properly downloads files using the audit-logged download endpoint
  - Uses `/api/documents/:id/download`
  - Creates blob and triggers browser download
  - Logs download action in audit system

### 2. ❌ Removed Non-Working Admin Buttons
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx`

**Removed Quick Action Cards:**
- "Department Overview" - Empty handler removed
- "Patient Statistics" - Empty handler removed

**Remaining Working Cards:**
- ✅ Manage Employees
- ✅ Manage Patient Accounts
- ✅ Doctor Availability
- ✅ System Audit Logs

### 3. ❌ Removed Non-Working Receptionist Button
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/receptionist/PatientDetailPage.jsx`

**Removed:**
- "Edit Patient Info" button (no handler implemented)

**Remaining:**
- ✅ "Book Appointment" button (working)

### 4. ❌ Removed Patient Portal Self-Service Features
**File**: `frontend/src/components/patient/UpcomingAppointments.jsx`

**Removed:**
- "Book Appointment" button from header
- "Book Appointment" button from empty state
- "View Details" button (empty handler)

**Changed empty state message to:**
"Please contact the reception to book an appointment"

**Note**: Reschedule, Cancel, and Add to Calendar buttons were already disabled

### 5. ❌ Removed Patient Portal Search Bar
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/patient/PatientPortalDashboard.jsx`

**Removed:**
- `<PortalSearchBar>` component
- `<PortalFiltersBar>` component
- Search functionality entirely

**Reasoning**: Patients should view their records through the portal, not search. Reception handles appointment booking.
